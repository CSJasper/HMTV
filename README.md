# Pytorch Implementation of paper "Human Motion Aware Text-to-Video Generation with Explicit Camera Control"

## Installation

### Environment
Our code was tested on CUDA 11.7, python3.8.
You can run this code with a single RTX 3090-24G

Using `environment.yml`,
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda active hmtv
```
or you can maunally create conda environment and use `requirements.txt` as below

```
conda create -n hmtv python=3.8 -y
conda activate hmtv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have trouble with `clip`, you can install with these scripts below

```
pip install ftfy regex tqdm
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git 
```
